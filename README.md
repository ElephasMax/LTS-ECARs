# LTS-ECARs

I wrote this program while working at Morgan Library to automate entry of items that will be sent to Surplus Property of Colorado State University. 


# How to use:

1. Populate `surplus.csv` with items that will be submitted 
2. `pip install -r surplus.csv` to install selenium.
3. Run ecars.py with `python ecars.py`
4. Enter the path to the CSV file (default is `./surplus.csv`)
5. Sign in to the ECARs website and navigate to the item entry page.
6. Return to the command prompt or terminal and type start to start the process.
